# Preview Environments on Kubernetes
Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates declarative configuration and automation. 
It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem.

# Okteto for preview environments

Using Okteto, you can configure Preview Environments for your code repositories. Every pull request will then get deployed and will get its own separate shareable URL. 

This allows teams to browse the changes in a pull request even before it gets merged - without taking care of any deployment-related setup. 

These URLs can also be shared with other stakeholders so that the review process isn't just limited to developers.
